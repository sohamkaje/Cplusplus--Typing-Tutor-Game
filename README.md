# Cplusplus--Typing-Tutor-Game
This program allows the user to play 4 games.
The first two games are to randomly spell 5 words, either from the dictionary or commonly misspelled words. Based on how many words they spell correctly and incorrectly, they'll be given a score depending on the points system
A third game is to choose a range of words in either the list of words from the dictionary, misspelled words, the corrected spelling for those misspelled words.
The last game allows the user to use the binary search algorithm to find a word that the user inputs in the dictionary. The program will show each turn until it finally ends up on the given word, unless its not a word in the dictionary.
